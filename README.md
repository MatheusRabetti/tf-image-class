# Image Classification

A generic image classifier program using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the pre-trained Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model called [Inception](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/train-your-own-image-classifier-with.html).

This model has been pre-trained for the [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) data, it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes The program applies Transfer Learning to this existing model and re-trains it to classify a new set of images.

This is a generic setup and can be used to classify almost any kind of image.
